Thanks for trying out this tribute to text adventure games of the past, 
while I hope 'we' (culture all the way from 1980's community work) try 
something new in terms of:

1 - Making players to not give up frustrated in their absolute first move
2 - Focus on playing experience, a mix of text adventure (TA) and interactive fiction (IF)
3 - Stay in old school environment *pure console*, using colors and ascii table fx;
4 - Use maps, hints, quests and awards to help people keep engaging in the game;

 Text Adventures (TA) & Interactive Fiction (IF)
--------------------------------------------------------

Pure text games were born in a time when computers didnt have most
graphical capabilites. Just like interactive books, the game makers
use text to give the players a fly into their own imagination while
the computer persisted the players decisions.

With the decline of TA because of the rise on the game graphics, these
type of games were introverted to a more niche location inside the
interactive fiction community (derived from books).

 What can be learned from past mistakes
--------------------------------------------------------

Games from 80's open the vault of interactivity, but could not compete
with even 8 bit era graphics, because:

-sentence logic "use sword on troll" completely non-intuitive;
-complicated puzzles for the sake of complexity (cruelty);
-required physical notes of locations for players to not get lost;

 The 'big boys games' style of text adventure
-----------------------------------------------

By experience, text adventures are EXTREMELY frustrating to newbies, and 
by this premisse, the games in this collection were thought out with these 
checkpoints in mind:

1) (very) limited actions:        

	No crazyness on the input. Inside the scene you can type anything, but is
	also expressed objetively as choice (1 - "do this", 2 - "do that") or 
	just what the "/help" provide as all the commands provided by the engine.

	Think of the input blinking cursor as "homage".

2) please forget about 'advanced' parsing, and let it stay DEAD:

	A "no boundaries" interface (even 3+ words) drives people CRAZY (and away to the 
	game) really f* fast ("turn off lamp", "rub oil lamp") -- also complicates 
	matters for everyone: coder and the player. 

3) hints:

	Just for people cheat legally in the game -- its counted and persisted
	on the save game. If you wanna go hardcore, just dont use it.  ;)

4) awards:

	To make our player visualize how much he explored the game, and can be
	a place to get a hint about what can you do.

5) quests / logs:

	Aid the player about what to do next, instead of wondering about.

6) on-game map:         

	No more Left, Right, West, East commands... lets provide the player with the 
	aid of some visualization of space represented in a simple ascii map.
	
	The focus is on interactivity and decision making, not memorization and
	eventually cruelty for the sake of being hard.

7) on-game map (fog of war):         

	Maps unfold themselves, not a big one map. You start in a "cave" and 
	you should see probably 3 or 4 maps as you go. Some maps have secrets.

7) modern RPG elements:

	we will use "gear", as a particular space of clothing and weapons.
	
	we will give limited space in inventory (to force the player to be
	very picky), and extensive use of fixed attibutes (ST,DX) and dinamic
	attributes (LIFE, MANA). Also, the player will use the world persistency
	to drop and take itens from the ground as needed -- this can be used 
	to 'mark territory' as well.

	we will give your character traits (positive and negative) to add a
	fluid chain of reaction unique for the type of play.

	lots of startups builds for the player experience the game differently
	every play.

8) turn fights:

	??

There will be MUCH LESS brutality on the interface and WAY less 
"player hostility" everywhere. 

Lets try to bring people in, not scare them out. ;)
